# this program takes the list of hex characters and adds them
# then negates each bit in the binary representation, then adds one to the result
# The binary value is then converted to hex this is what is returned

# Ask for all of the hex values that will be added


# pass the sum to the function hex2bin()


# hex2bin()returns the binary value, so you just add one to this , then negate the value
