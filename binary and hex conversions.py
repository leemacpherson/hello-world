 demonstrate that the conversions are correct
#hex_demo = hex(25)
#print (hex_demo)

#print("the value  of 25 should become 0x19 when converted to hex")

#decimal_demo = int("19", 16)
#print (decimal_demo)
#print("the value  of 19 should become 25 when converted to decimal")

# hex2bin()returns the binary value, so you just add one to this , then negate the value

# now add 1 to the negated hex value

# now convert this binary value to hex
